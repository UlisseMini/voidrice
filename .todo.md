# test networking in gopwn/pwn
* Need to refactor so i can use net.SetReadBuffer in tests

# proxy
* handler is already written in python, need to implement engine in go.
* implement cli for people without go installed (proxy/cli)
* put api inside struct so they don't need to constantly pass paramaters over and over.
* once finished put inside gopwn!

# chat application
* Figure out how i'm going to implement passwords (use database / don't allow same ip to create more then one account?)
* Maybe create API and use later for botnet ; )

# code shell in go
`
* Learn about parsing, so i can parse commandline arguments better
* Maybe use subprocesses instead of goroutines for my commands, but then how do i execute the functions in new processes?)
* ask around about how i should implement it
* implement shell redirection
* figure out how i can make it into a real terminal emulator ctrl+l ctrl+c etc (os/signal?)
* i might need to make it into a full pty for all the stuff i want, then i'll need to figure out how to do pty on windows (since i can't not support windows then who would use it lol)
* watch some talks about concurrentcy and scale (since this is kinda a big project)
